In my PhD, I investigated the interplay between reward prediction errors (RPEs; i.e., mismatches between reward outcome and reward expectation) and declarative learning (e.g., learning word pair associations). 

In the lab, we developed the variable-choice paradigm in which participants learned word pair associations coupled with RPEs of varying values and magnitudes. The goal of my PhD was to further investigate the robustness and generality of our recent findings. To this end, I used both behavioral and electrophysiological (i.e., EEG, tACS and eye tracking) measures. 

In [De Loof et al., 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189212") we showed that declarative learning is driven by signed RPEs (SRPEs). More specifically, recognition accuracy is driven by large, positive RPEs. In a subsequent study, we found neural oscillatory signatures that confirmed the experience of SRPEs boosting declarative learning [Ergo et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320676). This finding was further validated in an fMRI study [Buc Calderon et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1785-20.2020) where activity in the ventral striatum correlated with SRPEs. In 2020, we published a [review paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.02.009") on the role of reward prediction errors in declarative memory. Continuing on this research line, our [tACS study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237829) investigated whether theta (6 Hz) frequency tACS modulates reward prediction errors in declarative learning. In our [latest paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01952-7), we studied the effect of agency on reward prediction errors in declarative learning.
