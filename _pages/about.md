Welcome! My name is Kate and I'm a researcher funded by the [Research Foundation Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/) working in the [VergutsLab](https://www.cogcomneurosci.com/) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University - Belgium. During my PhD I investigated the interplay between reward prediction errors and declarative learning, but in general, I have very broad research interests.

On June 9, 2021 I succesfully defended my PhD. As of October 1, 2021 I will be looking for a new challenge. Want to get in touch? You can send me an email or shoot me a message through any of the social media icons linked below. 

June 2021: I'm currently still working on updating my website!
