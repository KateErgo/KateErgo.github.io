Welcome! My name is Kate and I'm a researcher funded by the [FWO](https://www.fwo.be/) working in the [VergutsLab](https://www.cogcomneurosci.com/) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University. I'm  interested in the interplay between reward prediction errors and declarative learning. 

On June 9, 2021 I succesfully defended my PhD. As of October 1, 2021 I will be looking for a new challenge. Want to get in touch? You can send me an [email](kate.ergo@ugent.be) or shoot me a message through any of the social media icons linked below. 

I'm currently still working on updating my website!
